## Prerequisites
If you don't already have an Apache local environment with PHP and MySQL, use one of the following links:
 - Windows: https://updivision.com/blog/post/beginner-s-guide-to-setting-up-your-local-development-environment-on-windows
 - Linux: https://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu
 - Mac: https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-install-mamp-on-your-mac/
Also, you will need to install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md   
And Laravel: https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation
## Installation
1. Unzip the downloaded archive
2. Copy and paste **argon-dashboard-pro-laravel-master** folder in your **projects** folder. Rename the folder to your project's name
3. In your terminal run `composer install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and updated the configurations (mainly the database configuration: database name, user name and password, set the APP_URL to the right path)
5. In your terminal run `php artisan key:generate`
6. Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create the database tables and seed the roles and users tables
7. Run `php artisan storage:link` to create the storage symlink (if you are using **Vagrant** with **Homestead** for development, remember to ssh into your virtual machine and run the command from there).

## Usage
Register a user or login with the default users with different roles from your database and start testing (make sure to run the migrations and seeders for these credentials to be available):
* **admin@argon.com** and password **secret**
* **creator@argon.com** and password **secret**
* **member@argon.com** and password **secret**

Besides the numerous types of dashboard, you can find pages for editing your profile, pages for managing the users, the roles, the items, the categories and the tags. There are also static pages for profile, for users, for projects, for accounts, for various applications, for ecommerce and different styles of pages for authentication. All the necessary files are installed out of the box and all the needed routes are added to `routes/web.php`. Keep in mind that all of the features can be viewed once you login using the credentials provided or by registering your own user.

## Documentation
The documentation for the Material Dashboard Laravel is hosted at our [website](https://www.creative-tim.com/live/argon-dashboard-pro-laravel/docs/bootstrap/overview/argon-dashboard/index.html).

### Login
If you are not logged in you can only access this page or the Sign Up page. The default url takes you to the login page where you use the default credentials **admin@argon.com** with the password **secret** but you can change them with the credentials for creator and for member. Logging in is possible only with already existing credentials. For this to work you should have run the migrations. The user also has the option to choose if he wants to be remembered or not.

The `App/Http/Controllers/App/LoginController.php` handles the logging in of an existing user.

```
    public function login(Request $request)
    {
        $credentials = $request->validate([
            'email' => ['required', 'email'],
            'password' => ['required'],
        ]);

        if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $request->email, 'password' => $request->password])) {
            $request->session()->regenerate();

            return redirect()->intended('/');
        }

        return back()->withErrors([
            'email' => 'The provided credentials do not match our records.',
        ]);
    }
```

### Register
You can register as a user by filling in the name, email, role and password for your account. For your role you can choose between the Admin, Creator and Member. It is important to know that an admin user has access to all the pages and actions, can delete, add and edit another users, other roles, items, tags or categories; a creator user has acces to category, tag and item management, but can not add, edit or delete other users; a member user has access to the item management but can not take any actions. You can do this by accessing the sign up page from the "**Sign Up**" button in the top navbar or by clicking the "**Sign Up**" button from the bottom of the log in form. Another simple way is adding **/register** in the url.

The `App/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php` handles the registration of a new user.

```
    $user = User::create([
        'firstname' => $attributes['firstname'],
        'email' => $attributes['email'],
        'role_id' => $attributes['role'],
        'password' => $attributes['password']
    ]);
    auth()->login($user);
```

### Forgot Password
If a user forgets the account's password it is possible to reset the password. For this the user should click on the "**here**" under the login form.

The `App/Http/Controllers/Auth/ResetPassword.php` takes care of sending an email to the user where he can reset the password afterwards.

```
    public function send(Request $request)
    {
        $email = $request->validate([
            'email' => ['required']
        ]);
        $user = User::where('email', $email)->first();

        if ($user) {
            $this->notify(new RecoverPassword($user->id));
            return back()->with('succes', 'An email was send to your email address');
        }
    }
```

### Reset Password
The user who forgot the password gets an email on the account's email address. The user can access the reset password page by clicking the button found in the email. The link for resetting the password is available for 12 hours. The user must add the new password and confirm the password for his password to be updated. The user is redirected to the login page.

The `App/Http/Controllers/Auth/ChangePassword.php` helps the user reset the password.

```
    if ($existingUser) {
        $existingUser->update([
            'password' => $attributes['password']
        ]);
        return redirect('login');
    } else {
        return back()->with('error', 'Your email does not match the email who requested the password change');
    }
```

### User Profile
The profile can be accessed by a logged in user by clicking "**User Profile**" from the sidebar or adding **/user-profile** in the url. The user can add information like phone number, location or change name, email and password.

The `App/Http/Controllers/UserController.php` handles the user's profile information.

```
    $user = User::create([
        'firstname' => $request->get('firstname'),
        'lastname' => $request->get('lastname'),
        'password' => $request->get('password'),
        'role_id' => $request->get('role'),
        'email' => $request->get('email'),
        'gender' => $request->get('gender'),
        'location' => $request->get('location'),
        'phone' => $request->get('phone'),
        'language' => $request->get('language'),
        'birthday' => $birthday,
        'skills' => $request->get('skills')
    ]);

    if($request->file('avatar')) {
        $user->update([
            'avatar' => $request->file('avatar')->store('/', 'avatars')
        ]);
    }
    }
```

        $user->delete();
        return redirect()->route('user-management')->with('succes', 'The user was deleted');
    }
```
Once the user pressed **Send** at the end of the form the new user is added to the table.
For authorizing this actions have been used policies such as `App\Policies\UserPolicy`:
```
    /**
     * Determine whether the authenticate user can manage other users.
     */
    public function manageUsers(User $user)
    {
        return $user->isAdmin();
    }

            'name' => ['required',  Rule::unique('roles')->ignore($role->id)],
            'description' => 'required'
        ]);

        $role->update($attributes);

        return redirect()->route('role-management')->with('succes', 'role succesfully updated');

            'tags' => ['required'],
        ]);

            'name' => $request->get('name'),
            'excerpt' => $request->get('excerpt'),
            'description' => $request->get('description'),
            'category_id' => $request->get('choices-category'),

        ]);

        $item->tags()->attach($request->get('tags'));

        if($request->file('picture')) {
            $item->update([
                'picture' => $request->file('picture')->store('/', 'items')
